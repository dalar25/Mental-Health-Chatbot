For example, chatbots can remind patients to measure their blood pressure, take medication, or schedule a meeting with their doctor. To take another example, chatbots can answer medical questions that people have and can even make diagnoses based on their self-reported symptoms.\n",

        "Congrats! Today, you've built a simple version of ELIZA, the world's first chatbot! Hopefully you've learned about how people think about designing rule-based chatbots, especially how hard it is to come up with all the rules that a chatbot needs to have in order for it to sound anything like a human. Think making all those rules is complicated? Me too. Luckily, there's a solution to this problem, and it's called *neural networks* - find out more about it in our next notebook!"
